The Tate Collection, Without Turner
===================================

The Tate Collection contains over 41,000 works by (or attributed to, or "after") Joseph Mallord William Turner, which tends to skew any random sampling of the collection as to make it almost unusable. This fork removes all Turners and Turner's profile so random samples "look random".
